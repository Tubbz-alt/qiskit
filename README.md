# Qiskit Hub 
Hello many worlds!


This repo will be a handy reference throughout my capstone project. For this project I shall aim to implement novel sound generation using Quantum Generative Adverserial Networks (QGANs). In order to implement this I shall be looking at Qiskit's existing implementation of QGANs, which has been applied to [finance](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/finance/03_european_call_option_pricing.ipynb).<br/>


I will be updating literature periodically as well as adding developments to the project whenever there is progress. More information can be found in the project proposals.
